# graphicool-gantt

> A Gantt charting application utilizing GraphQL.

## Installing / Getting started

### Initial Configuration

Some projects require initial configuration (e.g. access tokens or keys, `npm i`).
This is the section where you would document those requirements.

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing

In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy awesome-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Features

What's all the bells and whistles this project can perform?

- Allows for users to interact with a pre-populated Gantt chart through a React front-end hooked up to GraphQL, Node and Express.

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

#### Argument 1

Type: `String`  
Default: `'default value'`

State what an argument does and how you can use it. If needed, you can provide
an example below.

Example:

```bash
awesome-project "Some other value"  # Prints "You're nailing this readme!"
```

#### Argument 2

Type: `Number|Boolean`  
Default: 100

Copy-paste as many of these as you need.
